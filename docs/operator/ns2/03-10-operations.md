# {Component/Service Name} - Operations

<!--Please create only one single document with multiple sections for your Operations documentation. Our goal is to display all Operations content for a service on a single page so that the operators can quickly search for information using the search function.-->

<!--Recommended sections:

## REST API {if applicable}

## Custom Resources

In this section, describe:
- The component's CRs and their purpose
- CRs' backup requirements (Is it regenerated or does it require backup?)
- CRs' mechanics
- CRs' labels and annotations -->
