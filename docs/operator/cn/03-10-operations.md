# {Component/Service Name} - Operations

<!--Please create only one single document with multiple sections for your Operations documentation. Our goal is to display all Operations content for a service on a single page so that the operators can quickly search for information using the search function.-->

Provide details on  any injected configuration that the component expects. For example, ConfigMaps and/or Secrets.

- The component's CRs and their purpose
- CRs' backup requirements (Is it regenerated or does it require backup?)
- CRs' restoration order

## Metrics

In this section describe:
- What metrics endpoints does the component use? What is the metrics format? (Prometheus is expected)
- What metrics are presented on each endpoint? Describe all the metrics and what they represent.
