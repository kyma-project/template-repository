## General Guidelines

Our target persona has a good knowledge of the technical concepts involved, and does not need a detailed breakdown of steps at the click-level. If there are complicated procedures, use your judgment to break it into steps for easy consumption.

Although the target persona has the technical knowledge, they don't know Kyma specifics. Explain all the Kyma-related concepts and steps thoroughly with attention to details and understanding for the target user perspective.
